
✅ 1. Understanding Patient Demographics
Questions:

What’s the age distribution of patients?

are adverse reactions more common in specific sexes or age groups?

Suggested KPIs:

Average patient age by sex.

Patient distribution by state or country.

Percentage of patients in high-risk age groups (e.g., elderly).

✅ 2. Monitoring Treatment Effectiveness
Questions:

Which drug (Auralin or Novodra) results in better HBA1C improvement?

Are there patterns between demographics and treatment success?

Suggested KPIs:

Average HBA1C change per treatment type.

% of patients who improved HBA1C by at least .39 point.

HBA1C improvement rate by age group or sex.

✅ 3. Adverse Reactions Tracking
Questions:

Which treatments are associated with more adverse reactions?

Are specific adverse reactions common in certain groups?

Suggested KPIs:

Adverse reaction rate per drug.

Most common adverse reactions (Top 5).

% of patients with any reported adverse reaction.

✅ 4. BMI and Health Risk
Questions:

How does BMI correlate with treatment outcome?

Are overweight patients responding differently to treatments?

Suggested KPIs:

Average BMI by treatment group.

% of patients in each BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

Correlation between BMI and HBA1C change.

✅ 5. Data Quality / Completeness
Questions:

Are there any missing or inconsistent records?

Is patient information linked correctly across tables?

Suggested KPIs:

% of records with missing height, weight, or contact info.

% of patients without matched treatment or adverse reaction records.

Data consistency score (e.g., all names matched across tables).
